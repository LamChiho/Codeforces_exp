a:always pick one at first second, then use whatever time that is available.

b:find out how many positions need to be added, and always keep the k equal to the number. 

c:Any position must fall after the next one falls. 

d:The problem is, that if it is possible for B to stop A at how many points. Since A always move from smaller ones, so it's better think that, if in the future we will be unable to stop A at a smaller costed ones, then it's not that good since we fail at a1 point, and stop A at a2 point will make the remained unused chances worse than the alternative solution. Since this is the only thing that needs to be considered, so it's a N^2 problem.25*10^6,fixed.
